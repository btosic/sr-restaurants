## Preparing the project

Install the dependencies:

```npm i```

Sync the Postgres DB (check .env file DATABASE_URL for configuring your local Postgres URL):

```npm run db:push```

EMAIL_USERNAME and EMAIL_PASSWORD from .env should stay like they are now.
## Running and Debugging
To run the project:

```npm run dev```

To debug (if using VS Code), press F5.
